"""Bundled skills and the preloaded integration catalog.

Skills follow the Symphony SKILL.md model: a named, versioned markdown
procedure that is injected into agent context when enabled. The bundled set
below is adapted from Symphony's `.codex/skills/` catalog, generalized away
from Symphony-specific tooling.

The integration catalog preloads well-known MCP servers and APIs so builders
start from a vetted list; custom integrations remain fully supported through
the existing integrations CRUD.
